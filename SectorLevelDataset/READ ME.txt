The stata data file data_CMSM_COE_WACC_A38_2003_2015.dta presents sector-year level meaures for 2003-2015 of the Cost of Equity and the WACC for French private firms used in the paper "Investment and the WACC: new micro evidence for France" 
by Juan Carluccio, Clément Mazet-Sonilhac and Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier, Banque de France Working Paper Nr 710, 2018.

For details of the data construction please refer to the paper's main text and appendix.

The dataset contains 30 variables: 

A38: NAF Rev2 A38 sector code
YEAR: Year 
COE_NOMINAL_i where i runs from 2 to 8: Cost of Equity (calculated with i H = i in the DDM H-Model)
COE_REAL_i where i runs from 2 to 8: COE_NOMINAL_i deflated
WACC_NOMINAL_i where i runs from 2 to 8: Weighted-average cost of capital 
WACC_REAL_i where i runs from 2 to 8: WACC_NOMINAL_i deflated

Note that our preferred estimate of the CoE and the WACC (used in the paper) is H = 5

Sector-level variables are constructed as simple averages from firm-level data described in the paper.
