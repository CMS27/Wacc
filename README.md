# “Investment and the WACC: Firm-Level Evidence from France”
with *Juan Carluccio* and *Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier*

**Abstract** : We exploit a new dataset of consolidated balance sheets for some 1,850 private French corporate groups, in order to investigate the relationship between corporate investment and the cost of capital. We notably construct firm-level measures of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) that account for industry-specific values of the cost of equity and reflect the actual capital structure of firms. We find that a high WACC drags down investment: a one SD increase in the real WACC (+2 pp) is associated on average with a reduction by 0.65 pp in the investment rate.
