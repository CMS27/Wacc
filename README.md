The stata data file `data_CMSM_COE_WACC_A38_2003_2015.dta` presents **sector-year level meaures for 2003-2015 of the Cost of Equity and the WACC for French private firms** used in the paper "Investment and the WACC: new micro evidence for France" 

For details of the data construction please refer to the paper's main text and appendix.

The dataset contains 30 variables: 

- `A38`: NAF Rev2 A38 sector code
- `YEAR`: Year 
- `COE_NOMINAL_i` where i runs from 2 to 8: Cost of Equity (calculated with i H = i in the DDM H-Model)
- `COE_REAL_i` where i runs from 2 to 8: COE_NOMINAL_i deflated
- `WACC_NOMINAL_i` where i runs from 2 to 8: Weighted-average cost of capital 
- `WACC_REAL_i` where i runs from 2 to 8: WACC_NOMINAL_i deflated

Note that our preferred estimate of the CoE and the WACC (used in the paper) is **H = 5**
Sector-level variables are constructed as simple averages from firm-level data described in the paper.
